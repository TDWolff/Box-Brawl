# Box-Brawl
 You are a square in a 2D top-down shooter arena. Players navigate a procedurally generated map with simple obstacles (e.g., walls, trees, and water pools). The squares can shoot projectiles, place traps, or use power-ups. The goal is to survive and eliminate other players in a fast-paced multiplayer battle of up to 20 players.
